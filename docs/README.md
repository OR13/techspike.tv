A spike is a product-testing method originating from Extreme Programming that uses the simplest possible program to explore potential solutions.

For me, techspike's are how I improve my development skills. I choose to build things, often useless things, in order to understand how some tech works, or get comfortable doing something which takes practice.

If you want to request a spike, HMU in chat.

I plan to stream:

React / Web Development
Ethereum Development
Machine Learning Experiments
Chat Bot Dev
